Memory driver module

    This is a built in driver. It is loaded automatically. Configuring a driver with id=mem will
    generate a project load error.
    
    The mem driver is used to host in-memory tags. Any tag with undefined driverInfo will be
    added as an item. You could explicitly link a tag to memory by using driver id="mem"
